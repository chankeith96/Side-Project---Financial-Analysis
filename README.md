# Side-Project-Financial-Analysis
This is my first attempt at doing any “financial analysis”. In this code, I pull historical stock data to understand historical best and worst day returns, look at returns standard deviations to estimate volatility and risks, and visualize trends to predict growth or decay of stocks for companies I am interested in.

To any computer scientist, this code contains nothing beyond Python fundamentals. To any financial analysts, this analysis is probably what they’ve learned in freshman year. However, the plain simplicity of this project is exactly what needs to be shared. This work highlights what can be done with just the basic understandings of Computer Science and Finance, and of course, a little interest.
